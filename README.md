#Modifications:
##dkongo:
There is no modification due to nintendo having eliminated all of the empty bytes (I have to learn how to add more bytes to the ROM)
##bbredux:
Nothing, I haven't worked much time in it.
##pacman:
Change of some ASCII characters (doesn't really use ASCII, but it's own encoding)
##frogger:
Infinte lives and infinite coins modification
